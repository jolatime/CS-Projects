This is an implementation of Capture The Flag built in collaboration with my friend Alex Miller for our senior project. The idea came up because a professor of cybersecurity on campus, Dr. Jim Marquardson, needed a new service to run CTF challenges for his students. The issue with the service he was using was that each challenge instance took 5-10 minutes to launch + the flags were not unique between students. We tackled this issue by utilizing docker containers to hold the environment the user interacts with. The containers are very lightweight, and take less than a second to launch/switch between flags in a contest. We ensured dynamic flags by on-the-fly hashing based on user-specific information. Data on the site is held in a MySQL server, and the frontend is tied together using Angular.
